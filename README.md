# Deep-Learning-Gender-Recognition
This project implements a deep learning–based gender classification system using facial images. It includes data preprocessing, CNN model training, and transfer learning with MobileNetV2 and VGG16. A FastAPI server is developed to deploy the trained model for real-time gender prediction.
